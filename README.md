## Description
**Automatically generates visually similar product recommendations**

We offer testing with support for 30 days for free!

This plugin provides automatic creation of visually similar recommendations for all available products. The creation of these recommendations is possible using an innovative algorithm that automatically finds visually related products in all available categories. These visually related products will be displayed in the product detail page as a cross-selling tab.

In this plugin, the provided recommendations are created with a custom AI algorithm. This algorithm is running on an external server and a valid API key is needed to access this service.

Below is an example of visually similar recommendations of a red jacket. Other examples can be found in our demo store here: https://shopware.visualsearch.at

## Invoke Computation of Recommendations using Command

Alternatively, we provide you the possibility to manually computate product recommendations.

* Update of one category. This command will *check for missing cross-sellings* and perform update in two steps. First, it will search for the first category, which contains at least one product with missing cross-selling with the defined name (see 4. in Installation). Second, it will perform an update of the recommendations for all products in this category. You can invoke this update using e.g. this command with your sw-access-key: `curl --location --request POST 'https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/v3/vis/update_one_category' --header 'Authorization: Bearer XYZ' --data-raw ''`
* Check the status of cross-sellings. You can check for missing cross-sellings with the defined name (see 4. in Installation) using e.g. this command: `curl --location --request POST 'https://YOUR_DOMAIN/store-api/v3/vis/status_cross' --header 'sw-access-key: XYZ' --data-raw ''`
